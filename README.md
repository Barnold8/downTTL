# How to use

down TTL (time to live) takes in arguments at specific points

1. [totalSize] this is how big the download size is in GB
2. [currentDownloadAmount] this is how much of the download has been done in GB
3. [mbps] this is the given mbps, aka your download rate (go either for the lower end you have seen or the average for the best results)
4. [extra] this is just any amount of arguments. These are read as seconds and will be added onto the "seconds" amount for the shutdown timer

I shouldve written this in Python, I don't know why I chose C for a such a simple app...
